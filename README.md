In this document, there is a summary of a project summary to the client "The Gaming Room". Within the request was a detail document with software requirements for the game "Draw It or Lose It". The were looking to see what platform to develop their new game with and discription detailing comparisons. 

I believe in this documtent I did a good job repeating the style of the form given to use. I continued to use the template, but staying neat and organized with the data information. This is important practice for when I get to the real world. I need to not only be focused and thorough, but I need to stay organized for the client. 

This document I find the style of the comparison for the types of platforms and details of important features to add to the working progress. It explains that I understand the types of platforms, before I explain why I prefer my chosen platform.

It is important to consider the client when discribing the data. The information must be thorough, but simple to show it is easy for the client to understand the direction of the platform decision.
At the begining the base template given had a few base questions and a chart. I repeated this style when creating the other sections to help add similarity to the remaining information. This is important because it adds repeating pattern of reading method type to the text being read by the client.
